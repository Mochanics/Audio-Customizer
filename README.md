# Audio-Customizer
An extension for users with specific audio needs. It enables them to tune out low/high frequencies that they might be sensitive to, boost voices and force stereo audio to come out as mono.

More features might be added later as needed. Feel free to propose new features, improvements or bugfixes.

Current version: 1.1.0
